Suppose if we built a minPQ with following keys, then answer the following questions
I A M S T E V E R O G E R S

1.Write the output of the minPQ array ?
Ans:AEEIMORRSST
2.What are the child nodes for node ‘A’?
Ans:I,E
3.What is the root node after deleteMin() called 5 times?
Ans:O

					Learning by doing-1

Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E (where a letter means insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially empty priority queue. Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.
Ans: R R P O T Y I I U Q E U (E left on PQ)

Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?

Ans: yes. For a min heap, we must have A[Parent(i)] <= A[i]. For an array in sorted order, the children of any node at index k, if they exist, are at 2*k and/or 2*k + 1. Since the array is in sorted order and they are at a greater index, both children are greater than or equal to the parent, satisfying the min heap property.
