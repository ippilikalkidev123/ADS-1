1)	Give the output printed by java Stack for the input (where "-" means pop) 
“it was - the best - of times - - - it was - the - -“

Ans: In the above, given a string in middle of the string he also gave – symbol which
represents POP. Pop is used to remove the last entered element in the stack. 
From the above example when – symbol came it first eliminates the last entered string 
in the stack i.e., was and later the string moves forward when again – symbol came then 
it eliminates the word best. In the same string there is 3 – symbols which represents pop
function three times due to this the, of ,times will remove. Again one – symbol is there
it will pop the was from the string. Later again two – symbols are there due to this it 
and the will eliminate and finally only it will be there.
